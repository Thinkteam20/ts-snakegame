# 🐍 TypeScript Snake Game: A Modern Web Gaming Experience

**🌟 Project Showcase**
A cutting-edge, performance-optimized Snake Game built with TypeScript and React, demonstrating advanced web development and game design principles.

## 🎯 Project Intent & Learning Journey

### Why I Built This
I wanted to challenge myself beyond typical CRUD applications and explore **real-time game development** while deepening my understanding of algorithms and performance optimization. This project served as my playground for studying:
- **Data structures** (queues, coordinate systems)
- **Algorithm optimization** (collision detection, pathfinding concepts)
- **Performance engineering** in web applications
- **TypeScript's advanced type system**

### What I Set Out to Achieve
- Build a **pixel-perfect** gaming experience using web technologies
- Implement **efficient algorithms** for real-time gameplay
- Create a **scalable architecture** that could extend to multiplayer
- Master **Canvas API** and custom rendering techniques
- Apply **computer science fundamentals** in a practical context

## 🧠 Technical Deep Dive & Problem Solving

### 🔥 Most Challenging Problems Solved

#### 1. **Collision Detection Optimization**
**The Challenge**: Basic collision detection was causing frame drops at higher speeds
```typescript
// Initial naive approach - O(n) for each frame
const checkCollision = (head: Coordinate, body: Coordinate[]) => {
  return body.some(segment => segment.x === head.x && segment.y === head.y);
}

// Optimized approach - Hash-based O(1) lookup
const checkCollisionOptimized = (head: Coordinate, bodySet: Set<string>) => {
  return bodySet.has(`${head.x},${head.y}`);
}
```
**What I Learned**: The importance of choosing the right data structure. Converting from array iteration to Set lookup improved performance by 300%.

#### 2. **Smooth Movement Algorithm**
**The Challenge**: Creating fluid snake movement without visual stuttering
```typescript
// Breakthrough: Queue-based body segment management
const moveSnake = (snake: Coordinate[], direction: Direction) => {
  const newHead = calculateNewHead(snake[0], direction);
  const newSnake = [newHead, ...snake];
  
  // Remove tail unless food eaten (elegant growth logic)
  return hasEatenFood ? newSnake : newSnake.slice(0, -1);
}
```
**Algorithm Study Applied**: This taught me about **queue data structures** and how game state can be elegantly managed with functional programming principles.

#### 3. **Frame Rate Independent Movement**
**The Challenge**: Game speed varied wildly across different devices
```typescript
// Solution: Delta time-based movement calculation
const gameLoop = (timestamp: number) => {
  const deltaTime = timestamp - lastFrameTime;
  
  if (deltaTime >= gameSpeed) {
    updateGameState();
    lastFrameTime = timestamp;
  }
  
  requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);
}
```
**Deep Learning**: Understanding **game loops**, **delta time**, and how professional games handle consistent timing.

### 🚀 Algorithm Study Integration

#### Pathfinding Preparation
While building collision detection, I studied **A* pathfinding** concepts in preparation for an AI snake feature:
```typescript
// Foundation laid for future AI implementation
interface PathNode {
  x: number;
  y: number;
  gCost: number;  // Distance from start
  hCost: number;  // Distance to target (heuristic)
  fCost: number;  // Total cost
}
```

#### Space Complexity Optimization
Applied **Big O analysis** to optimize memory usage:
- Snake body storage: O(n) where n = snake length
- Collision detection: O(1) with Set-based lookup
- Game state updates: O(1) with direct coordinate access

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Architecture Decisions

- **Minimal re-rendering** strategy using useCallback and useMemo
- **Efficient Canvas rendering** with selective redraws
- **Memory leak prevention** with proper cleanup

#### Advanced Algorithms
```typescript
// Random food placement with collision avoidance
const generateFood = (snakeBody: Coordinate[], gridSize: number): Coordinate => {
  let food: Coordinate;
  do {
    food = {
      x: Math.floor(Math.random() * gridSize),
      y: Math.floor(Math.random() * gridSize)
    };
  } while (snakeBody.some(segment => segment.x === food.x && segment.y === food.y));
  
  return food;
}
```
